					<p class="blerb">In a city inhabited by anthropomorphic animals who have abandoned traditional predator/prey roles in favor of civilized coexistence, uptight rabbit police 
					officer Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) is forced to work with charismatic fox con artist Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) to crack a major case involving the mysterious 
					disappearance of some carnivorous citizens. But when a few of the missing critters reappear, having reverted to pre-enlightenment savagery, it exposes existing anti-carnivore 
					prejudice among the city's herbivores that threatens to damage the fabric of their diverse metropolis. Shakira, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Nate Torrence, Jenny Slate, Tommy Chong, 
					Octavia L. Spencer, Bonnie Hunt, Alan Tudyk, Don Lake, and John DiMaggio also lend their voices. ~ Violet LeVoit, Rovi</p>
